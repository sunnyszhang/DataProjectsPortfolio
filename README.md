# Sunny Zhang's Data Projects Portfolio
This repository aggregates all of the data projects I've worked on so far. This page is frequently updated to showcase new skills learned through new projects completed. 

## Excel Project - [Pacific Ocean Temperature Trends Over the Past Century](https://github.com/sunnyszhang/ExcelAnalysis/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20Ocean%20Temperature%20and%20Salinity%20in%20British%20Columbia%20-%20Journal.pdf)

### Skills Demonstrated
In this project, I analyze the surface level temperature data of the Pacific Ocean obtained from the Government of Canada's public site. Some skills highlighted in this project include:
  1. Creating visualizations using Excel's built-in tools
  2. Importing external CSV files into Excel
  3. Cleaning and formatting the data with the help of Macros
  4. Leveraging advanced functions such as VLOOKUPs
  5. Utilizing conditional formatting to enhance quantitative data presentation
  6. Generating descriptive statistics using Excel's built-in Analysis Tool-Pak

## RStudio Project - [Pacific Ocean Temperature Trends Over the Past Century](https://github.com/sunnyszhang/RStudio/blob/main/Pacific%20Ocean%20Temperature%20Trend%20Past%20Century%20-%20RStudio.pdf)

### Skills Demonstrated
In this project, I used public Government of Canada data to determine how the Pacific Ocean's surface level temperature harbouring British Columbia has changed over the past century. Some of the skills highlighted in this project include:
  1. Creating a R-Markdown (RMD) file for easy review, data sharing, and analysis reporting to peers, colleagues, and my future-self
  2. Importing and manipulating external data using the *Tidyverse* package found within R
  3. Cleaning data using a sub-package of the Tidyverse called *dplyr*
  4. Making visualizations using another sub-package of the Tidyverse called *ggplot*
  5. Peforming calculations across rows or columns, along with handling fields with error values like "NAs"

### Discoveries and Findings
Our analysis of the dataset indicates that there has been an upwards trend in surface level temperature in the Pacific Ocean based on the 12 sites for which this data was collected along the coasts of British Columbia. The linear regression model created, illustrating the temperature changes of the past century per season, corroborates this finding. This could be indicative in showcasing the reality behind climate change.  

## SQL Project - [FitBit User Data](https://github.com/sunnyszhang/SQL_Project/blob/main/Bellabeats%20SQL%20Notebook%20-%20For%20GitHub.ipynb) (Google Data Analytic's Certificate Capstone Project)
### Skills Demonstrated
In this project, I used SQL to clean, manipulate, and analyze FitBit User data obtained from Kaggle to identify the trends found among FitBit watch users and what most individuals use their watches for. Some of the skills highlighted in this project include:
  1. Accessing and retrieving data stored in CSV files using the *SELECT*, *FROM*, and *WHERE* 
  2. Manipulating stored data in the CSV format to display key information that's being sought after using *ARRANGE*, *GROUPBY*, and *ORDERBY* statements
  3. Using *NESTED QUERIES* to be able to intricatly manipulate data from single or multiple CSV files simultaneously
  4. Performing basic descriptive statistic calculations using syntaxes such as *AVG*, *MIN*, *MAX*, and *COUNT*
  5. Aggregating separate data files into a single table output to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data using *JOINS*, *LEFT JOIN*, *RIGHT JOIN*, *OUTER JOIN*, *IN*, and *SELF JOINs*
