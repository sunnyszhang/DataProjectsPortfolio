# Sunny Zhang's Data Projects Portfolio
This repository aggregates all of the data projects I've worked on so far

## SQL Project - [FitBit User Data](https://github.com/sunnyszhang/SQL_Project/blob/main/Bellabeats%20SQL%20Notebook%20-%20For%20GitHub.ipynb) (Google Data Analytic's Certificate Capstone Project)
#### Description
In this project, I used SQL to clean, manipulate, and analyze FitBit User data obtained from Kaggle to identify the trends found among FitBit watch users and what most individuals use their watches for. Some of the skills highlighted in this project include:
  1. Accessing and retrieving data stored in CSV files using the *SELECT*, *FROM*, and *WHERE* 
  2. Manipulating stored data in the CSV format to display key information that's being sought after using *ARRANGE*, *GROUPBY*, and *ORDERBY* statements
  3. Using *NESTED QUERIES* to be able to intricatly manipulate data from single or multiple CSV files simultaneously
  4. Performing basic descriptive statistic calculations using syntaxes such as *AVG*, *MIN*, *MAX*, and *COUNT*
  5. Aggregating separate data files into a single table output to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data using *JOINS*, *LEFT JOIN*, *RIGHT JOIN*, *OUTER JOIN*, *IN*, and *SELF JOINs*
